        <p>I am a seasoned full-stack data scientist with a proven track record in building AI-based products from the ground up.</p>
        <p>As one of the founding tech members at two AI-based startups, I've played a pivotal role in conceiving and developing innovative products. Currently, I'm at the helm of a cutting-edge Generative AI project at Petonic Infotech, aimed at providing businesses with actionable recommendations and strategies.</p>
        <p>My previous role at ExactSpace Technologies allowed me to leverage my expertise in data analysis. I helped the company harness the power of AI to eliminate unplanned failures in various industries across domains like Power Generation, Green Energy, Oil & Gas etc. I believe that access to data is only half the equation; the other half lies in translating that data into meaningful insights. By integrating advanced analytics, machine learning, and domain knowledge, I created highly tailored solutions to deliver maximum impact for our clients.</p>
        <p>I am proficient in a wide array of analytics tools and languages. My skill set includes data cleaning, transformation, statistical modeling, and deploying analytics solutions across various platforms. I also have a passion for exploring the ever-evolving fields of Data Analytics and Big Data.</p>
        <p>Let's connect and explore opportunities in the data science world!</p>
